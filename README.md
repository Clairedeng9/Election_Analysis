# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
To better help the election commission successfully complete the audit work, in this project, use Python language to return the voter turnout for each county and each candidate, the percentage of votes from each county and each candidate out of the total count, the county with the highest turnout, and the winner of the election with winning vote count and winning percentage of votes. To better present the results, a txt. file was generated to save all results.
