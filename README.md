# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
To better help the election commission successfully complete the audit work, in this project, use Python language to return the voter turnout for each county and each candidate, the percentage of votes from each county and each candidate out of the total count, the county with the highest turnout, and the winner of the election with winning vote count and winning percentage of votes. To better present the results, a txt. file was generated to save all results.

## Election-Audit Summary
To be more flexibele for election audit purpose, this script can be used with some modifications for any election, providing below scripts as examples to show the reasons.
1. Apply to any election commissions, first screenshot will collect candidate's names row by row, and next no matter how many different candidates in the election next scrip will generate a complete candidate list.

Overall, by seeing the result of the analysis election and the sample scripts applying to this election project, this script is ideally and flexibly suited for any other elections.
